# AGENTS.md — Medical Study Corpus (D:/corpus)

## Corpus Structure & Archive Status

**Effective 2026-05-04**: D:/corpus is the root of a medical study corpus for CMED4IIM1/IIM2 covering 8 subjects: cardiology, diabetes, endocrine, gastroenterology, geriatric, nephrology, pulmonology, rheumatology.

Each subject originally had three subdirectories:
- `audio-transcripts/` — **moved to C:/medbak/<subject>/** (cross-drive archive)
- `book-texts/` — **moved to C:/medbak/<subject>/** (cross-drive archive)
- `srs-cards/` — **remains at D:/corpus/<subject>/**

Only srs-cards remain at the corpus root; all other source materials are now on the C: drive.

## Generated Artifacts

Per-subject files at D:/corpus root:
- `*_triage_scenarios.yml` (all 8 subjects) — parameterized clinical triage scenarios extracted from SRS cards
- `concise/<subject>_study_guide.md` (all 8 subjects) — human-readable rollup study guides

## Observability Website

Static site at `D:/corpus/site/`:
- Files: `index.html`, `style.css`, `app.js`, `srs.js`, `triage-live.{html,js,css}`
- Data: `data/` shards + `data/manifest.json`
- Server: `node D:/corpus/scripts/serve.js` listens on port 8765

## Live Triage System

Standalone page at `site/triage-live.html` (linked from main nav). 3-pane layout: scenario list (left, with subject-filter chips and stats row), active scenario + scratchpad (center), model bay + chat composer (right).

- 68 scenarios across 8 subjects, all canonicalized at build time to `{name:str, description:str, parameters:obj, examples:arr, atom_ids:arr}`. `scripts/build_data.js loadTriage` coerces alt-shape (rheumatology `title`/`scenarios[].variant`) and stringified flow-map params (cardiology) into the canonical shape.
- LLM: lazy-loads `@huggingface/transformers@3.5.0` and `onnx-community/gemma-4-e2b-it-ONNX` on WebGPU when the user opts in. Tool calls (`add_card`, `remove_card`, `highlight_card`, `clear_screen`) parsed from fenced ` ```tool ` blocks; each turn rebuilds a fresh system prompt from the active scenario + current scratchpad — chat history pruned to 1 user + 1 assistant message after every turn.
- Disclosure gate (`gate-scenario-disclosure`): the active-scenario panel renders only the case stem + a "what to supply" checklist (differentials / investigations / plan); it does NOT render `sc.parameters` or any atoms-attached count. `buildSnapshot(phase)` takes an explicit phase argument — `'asking'` returns stem + scratchpad only (zero atom definitions, zero example reasoning/recommendation, zero atom fronts), `'grading'` injects the canonical atoms + recommendation as the answer key. `simulateAssistant` is Socratic in `asking` (never auto-populates differentials/plans/investigations; only `add_card` if the student types `add <kind>: <title>`); on `submit for grading` the phase flips, `gradeAgainstAtoms` token-overlap matches student cards to canonical atoms (≥2 token hits → `highlight_card`), missing atoms become `add_card kind=note title="missed: …"`. The LLM system prompt only carries the answer key when `phase==='grading'`.
- Simulate path: deterministic offline assistant — Socratic in asking, atom-grader in grading. Used as the offline witness.
- Persistence: `corpus.triage.v1` localStorage key, schema-versioned `{version, sessions:{scenarioId:cards[]}, savedAt}`. Restored on `selectScenario`. Export downloads JSON; import re-hydrates.
- Keyboard: `j`/`k` next/prev scenario, `c` clear scratchpad, `/` focus prompt, `Ctrl+Enter` send.
- Accessibility: `role=button` + `tabindex=0` on scenario rows, `aria-pressed` on chips, focus-visible outlines, mobile single-column at ≤1100px.

## SRS Review System

Ported from `C:/dev/srs-mccqe1` on 2026-05-04. Browser-side SM-2 review engine — no server, no Node CLI.

- `site/srs.js` — SM-2 algorithm (calcSM2, compressInterval) + state layer (loadStates/saveStates/updateCard/getDueCards/getScheduleStats) + exam-date config. Exposes `window.__srs` for witnessing.
- Persistence: `localStorage` keys `corpus.srs.states` (per-card `{easeFactor, interval, repetitions, dueDate, lastScore}`) and `corpus.srs.config` (`{examDate}`, default `2026-06-15`).
- `#review` route: shows due-card queue, reveal-then-grade (0–5 SM-2 buttons), advances on grade, skip option, subject filter, session-graded counter.
- `#stats` route: `#srs-stats` panel with total/scheduled/due/avgEF/avgLastScore/daysToExam/effectiveDays + exam-date input + reset button.
- All cards default to due-today until first graded. Interval compression by exam-date pressure (`effectiveDays = daysUntilExam − 14`).
- Not ported: AI-graded sessions, daily planner LLM rationale, syllabus loader (depend on `acpreact` + external CLIs unavailable here). Self-grade is the review path.

## Corpus Statistics

Totals across all 8 subjects:
- **1958 SRS cards**
- **901 reasoning atoms**
- **68 triage scenarios**
- **56 audio lectures**
- **135 book sections**
- **~956 KB** study guide markdown

## Repository State

- Git identity: `lanmower` (almagestfraternite@gmail.com)
- No GitHub remote (local-only repo)
- Current branch: master
- Main branch: main

Unwitnessed gap (carry-forward): physical browser click-event wiring on `site/triage-live.html` was not witnessed in the session that built it — `exec:browser` could not bind port 9225 in that environment. Node-side coverage is complete (HTML/JS/CSS served, `PERSIST_KEY`/`persistActive`/j-k handlers present, 68/68 scenarios over HTTP, tool-dispatch + localStorage round-trip simulated, rheumatology schema-fix verified). Re-witness from a normal browser env: load the page, click a scenario, press j/k, send a chat message, confirm localStorage persistence and DOM updates fire.
